## Terminal Debloater
[More info and details in the XDA Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-terminal-debloater-debloat-t3584163)

Debloat your phone Systemlessly!
With your own choices in Terminal Emulator menu.
Just enter this command in Terminal Emulator:

	debloat_magisk
	
And you will be presented with a list of app names inside /system.
Just reboot and you will have it removed, systemless-ly :D

#### Thanks is always appreciated :)
