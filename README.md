## Terminal Debloater

Debloat your phone with style!
With your own choices in Terminal Emulator menu.
Just enter this command in Terminal Emulator:

	debloat_magisk
	
And you will be presented with a list of app names (not accurate, depending on folder name) inside /system.
Just reboot and you will have it removed, systemless-ly :D
