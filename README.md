## Debloater (Terminal Emulator)
[More info and details in the XDA Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-terminal-debloater-debloat-t3584163)

 Debloat your phone Systemlessly!
 With your own choices in Terminal Emulator menu.
 Just enter this command in Terminal Emulator:

	debloat
	
 And you will be presented with a list of apps inside /system.
 Just reboot and you will have it removed, systemless-ly
 
## Error?
 Go to the menu and type `logs`, this will upload the log files of this module and will generate a link. Send that :)
 Alternatively, Send `/cache/terminal_debloater-verbose.log` in the XDA thread. I'll examine it for problems and will try to fix it.
